# jsDatePick
After watching Chrome Dev Summit Frameworks panel, datepicker was mentioned and most interestingly the willingness
from the JS community to create one Date Picker to rule them all. Everytime we need to create a date picker for our
products we find ourselfs in the position of re-inventing the same wheel all over again.

This project aims at solving the issue with datepickers and calendars in modern JS front-end world.

Features:
  1. use native browser picker
  2. cross-framework support (can be used with VueJS, React...)
  3. expose an easy API for great dev experience
  
Issues:
 1. Browser support for <input type=date /> is very limited
